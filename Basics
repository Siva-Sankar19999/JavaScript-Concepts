->Javascript Important concepts about prototype:
                                       https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginners-guide-to-javascripts-prototype/

->Async, Defer attributes in script tag :

1. when we reload the browser first browser starts parsing the HTML and when it sees any script tag no attributes(async,defer) it will stop parsing and fetch JS file and execute it .Because of this behaviour we place script tag in end of body tag.  

2.Async : while browser parsing the HTML it sees any script tag with async attribute it parallely fecth JS file while parsing and when JS file has completed fetching. then browser stops parsing and execute js file. 
                                            a) It will be good for google analytics 
                                            b) when there are js files which are dependent of each other we should not use async attribute
3.Defer : while browser parsing the HTML it sees any script tag with defer attribute it parallely fecth JS file while parsing and when JS file has completed fetching. then browser will not stop HTML parsing and execute js file after HTML file has completed parsed.

->Exection context
	1.Everything in javascript happens in execution context
	2.when javascript engine begins start executing there will be two phases 1. Memory creation Phase 2.Code execution Phase
		* 1.Memory creation Phase : In Memory phase, memory will be allocated only.
						   a) For variables, Memory will be allocated and undefined value will be assigned to the variables in memory phase.
						   b) For Functions, Memory will be  allocated and entire function will be assigned to it.
		* 2.Code execution Phase : In code phase, real code will start executing 
						   a) For variables, calculation,etc will be done and real values will be assigned (Like replacing the undefined values    							 for variables in code phase)	
						   b) For function calls, there will be another execution context will be created and same process will happen like above                                                       and when it sees a return statement or end of statement the inner execution context will be deleted and return the                                                       control to global execution context
