-> This keyword : 

1.Inside a global space :
    Inside a global space 'this' refers to globalobject and globalobject may be window,global etc
    depends on where we are running javascript (javascript runtime environment)

2.Inside a function :
     'This' value inside a function is 'undefined' but because of javascript 'this substitution' it is 
     globalobject (only in non-strict mode)

    In strict mode this value is 'undefined'

    Note: 'This substitution' - If the value of 'this' value is undefined then it will replaced with
           globalobject.

3.This keyword value also depends on how the function is called [with respective to strict mode]

      function a(){
        console.log(this);
      }

   a(); -> this value is undefined
   window.a(); -> this value is window

4.This keyword value inside a object's method 
   
   const obj={
    x:10,
    a : function(){
          console.log(this.x);         // output -> 10;
        }
    }

  In above this keyword value inside a object's method is object itself 

5.Call, Apply and Bind methods (sharing methods)
  call,apply and bind methods are used to modify the value of 'this' inside function

  const obj1={
    name: "Meena",
    printName : function (){
      console.log(this.name);     // output : Meena
    }
  }

  const obj2={
    name : "kishore",
  }

  obj1.printName.call(obj2);      // output : kishore

6.This keyword inside a arrow function
  Arrow functions don't have this binding and 'this' value will be their enclosing lexical context.

  Lexical Context : Where it is present in the code / accessible

 eg:1 const school={
    name : "Meena",
    x : ()=>{
      console.log(this);   // output : window object
    }
  }

  Here, above arrow function is present in school object and school object is accessible in window object
  then this value is window object

   eg:2 const school={
    name : "Meena",
    x : function(){
      const y =()=>{
        console.log(this)
      }
      y();
    }
  }

  Here , above arrow function is present in x method and x method is accessible in school object and
  this value is school object

7. This keyword inside DOM  
   This refers to element
