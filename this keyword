-> This keyword : 

1.Inside a global space :
    Inside a global space 'this' refers to globalobject and globalobject may be window,global etc
    depends on where we are running javascript (javascript runtime environment)

2.Inside a function :
     'This' value inside a function is 'undefined' but because of javascript 'this substitution' it is 
     globalobject (only in non-strict mode)

    In strict mode this value is 'undefined'

    Note: 'This substitution' - If the value of 'this' value is undefined then it will replaced with
           globalobject.

3.This keyword value also depends on how the function is called with respective to strict mode

   function a(){
     console.log(this);
   }

   a(); -> this value is undefined
   window.a(); -> this value is window

4.This keyword value inside object method
